    <p> Hey There!</p>
    <br>
    <pre>My name's Venkatesh, i am currently a student of UNSW studying Software Engineering and Commerce. 
Im 18 years old and living in Sydney in the West. This website is more of a testing ground for my 
HTMl skills and how they increase and change as my coding skills increase. Currently this website 
exists to provide evidence that i have done something with my Something Awesome for COMP1917.
    </pre>
<pre>Some of my hobbies include gaming, going to the gym and building computers. Naturally
i gravitated to software engineering as i do have a passion for computers and learning about coding
seems like a lot of fun (although right now it is a struggle since im new to it all).

I should be updating this website in future with more info! If you wanna contact me you can 
send me an email at venkatesh.vasudevan20@gmail.com or send me a message on facebook
